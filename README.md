# Apple Static Website

A small static website inspired by Apple's design language. This repository contains a simple HTML/CSS site suitable for learning, demonstration, or a starting template for a personal project.

## Contents

- `index.html` — The main HTML page.
- `style.css` — Styles for the site (responsive, minimal layout).
- `README.md` — This file.

## Preview

To view the site locally, open `index.html` in your browser. From a terminal you can also run a simple static server (recommended) to get correct relative path handling:

```bash
# using Python 3 (macOS has Python 3 if installed)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Project purpose

This repo is intended as a minimal, static example to:

- Practice HTML/CSS structure and responsive design.
- Serve as a lightweight landing page or portfolio starter.

## Development notes

- Edit `index.html` to change content and structure.
- Update `style.css` to customize fonts, colors, spacing, and responsive behavior.
- Keep assets (images, icons) in a new `assets/` folder if you add them.

### Suggested enhancements

- Add a favicon and meta tags for better UX and SEO.
- Introduce a small build step (e.g., PostCSS) if you expand styles.
- Add a contact form backend or use a service like Formspree for submissions.

## File structure

```
./
├─ index.html       # main page
├─ style.css        # styles
└─ README.md        # this file
```

If you'd like, I can also:

- Add a basic favicon and meta tags to `index.html`.
- Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes, skip links).
- Create a small GitHub Pages workflow to publish the site.

Tell me which of these (or other) enhancements you'd like next.
